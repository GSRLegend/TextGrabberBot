# TextGrabberBot
Returns text found in images

In both config.properties files, change the botToken to your bot's Token.

(Fun fact, I forgot to remove my token from the original Commit. My bot was a temporary shell and has been deleted so it doesn't impact me, but make sure to not make my mistake)

To run the bot, run the code in TextGrabber.java in your IDE or on a cloud hosting service.

To use the bot, run /textgrab in discord, and attach the file you need text from.
Since the training data is from english text, the best use is on typed text. You can get some functionality from mathematical text, and even less from images containing things other than text that might mess with the OCR.
